I created an account and api key over at:
sportsdata.io

I used insomnia to test and pull a set of data via a GET request of weekly scores:
https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/nfl/scores/json/ScoresByWeek/

I then streamed a get request of scores over to my Keen.io project

I studied the data model and key value pairs.

Then I created and saved the queries I wanted to read into my dashboard.

I used our Keentroversy template to manipulate a quadrant of charts and voila.
